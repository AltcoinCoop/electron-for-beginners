#Part 1

Some initial setup should be done before we start working on our first electron project.

**Steps:**

1. Install Node.js and add npm to your path. (Note: This is automatically done sometimes.)

2. Create a directory for your application, for the purposes of this project, this will be done on the desktop.

3. Navigate to your desktop via your terminal or command line and `mkdir electronbeginner`

4. CD into that directory and open a terminal or command line window there and type `npm init` to run through the project setup.

5. Great! Now just type `npm install electron-prebuilt --save` to install your electron module.

6. Thats it! Your project environment for a basic Electron application is done!

***Optional:*** Add a .gitignore/node_modules in your project when using git to reduce the size of your project.
